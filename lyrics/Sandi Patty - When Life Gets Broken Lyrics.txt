Hands reaching out with no one to hold
You've been abandoned with no place to go
Wounded and wanting, such desperate times
Cold bitter tears are filling your eyes

Get a glimpse of Jesus for He is right there with you
He knows just what you need

'Cause when life gets broken, when you're in despair
He'll carry your burden when it's too much to bear
It's down in the valley where He'll give you strength
And there is nothing you have lost that He can't replace
He'll help you start all over again
When life gets broken

You hoped God would heal it, but the storm raged and raged
Now it's hard to imagine how you'll make it through the day
Weeks turn to years, time's passing you by
But you're still holding on to the how's and the why's

So get a glimpse of Jesus for He is right there with you
He knows just what you need

'Cause when life gets broken, when you're in despair
He'll carry your burden when it's too much to bear
It's down in the valley where He'll give you strength
And there is nothing you have lost that He can't replace
He'll help you start all over again
When life gets broken

Healing waters heal our troubled souls
Jesus, sweet Jesus will cleanse and make us whole

When life gets broken, when you're in despair
He'll carry your burden when it's too much to bear
It's down in the valley where He'll give you strength
And there is nothing you have lost that He can't replace
He'll help you start all over again
He'll help you start all over again
He'll help you start all over again
He'll help you start all over again
When life gets broken
