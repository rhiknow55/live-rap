It's Fuckin' Treyway!
King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, You got the right one
Let these bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

Pussy got that wet, wet
Got that drip, drip
Got that super soaker
Hit that, she a Fefe
Hun' and Keke, she clean my dick like a freak, freak
I don't even know like "why I did that?"
I don't even know like "why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Murder that damn thing and make it clap, clap, clap

I don't really want no fame
I don't really want no friends, no

Draco got that kick-back
When I blow that thing on your track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tie, yeah, I think that, yeah, I live that
Call an Uber with my shooter
With a Ruger, we gon' do these
Say they killing people but I really fucking do it

I don't really want no fame
I don't really want no friends, no

He tryna 69 like Tekashi call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep my Rocky
I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse
Copped my Khloe like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace
Said I'm pretty like Tinashe
P-Put it all up in his face
Did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days
I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
Yo, how'd it taste!?

I don't really want no fame
I don't really want no friends, no

Ayo!
Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get your shit back
In fact, this that bitch that
"I hate small talk, I don't fuck with chit-chat"
AC just stopped working, so they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rocking fashions
That got all these bitches like "Yo, what's that?"

I don't really want no fame
I don't really want no friends, no

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a hoe right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that hoe right through the door (Tr3yWay)
I don't really want friends
My old hoe just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit
"I won't see that bitch again"

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a hoe right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that hoe right through the door (Tr3yWay)

Mmm, Young Money, Young Money bunny
Colorful hair, don't care
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Scum Gang!
