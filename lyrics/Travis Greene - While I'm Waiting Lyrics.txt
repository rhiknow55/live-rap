What my eyes can't see I still believe
Everything spoken to me
There's no word that can come back void
I will trust the report of the Lord

God is not a man that He should lie
Every need He will supply
So I will wait, I will not be moved
I believe, I believe, I will trust in You

While I'm waiting I'm getting stronger
My faith is rising, and I will run on
While I'm waiting, I'm lifting up on wings as eagles
I believe, I will trust in You

Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You

What my eyes can't see
What my eyes can't see
I still believe

Everything
Everything spoken to me
There's no word
There's no word that can come back void
I will trust
I will trust the report of the Lord

That's why
God is not a man that He should lie
Every need
He will
He will supply
