[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
My friends, real friends, better than your friends
That's how we keep poppin' out that Benz, yeah
No foes, real friends, we ain't even got to pretend, yeah
Get bands, get bands, spend it all on my friends

[Refrain: BeyoncÃ©]
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
And never let me down (they never let me down)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
And never let me drown (never let me down)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
I'll never hit the ground (never let me drown, never let me drown)

[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
My friends, real friends, better than your friends, yeah
Thats how we keep popping out that Benz, yeah
For friends, real friends, better than your friends, yeah
That's them, that's them, they know all my business

[Verse 1: BeyoncÃ©]
I don't know what I would do without all of my crew, yeah
I ain't makin' no room, yeah, I ain't makin' no new friends
I don't make no moves, yeah, without tellin' my crew, yeah
That just how we do, yeah, that just how we do, oh
Damn it, I love my life, Styrofoam cups, no ice
Party 'fore we go inside
Never let them out my sight, they're right by my side
Them my ride-or-dies, them my ride-or-dies
My friends are goals, your friends are foes
We fly, why cry, our souls exposed, yeah
We smoke, we laugh, your stress, my stress
Closer than kin, I'm blessed, you blessed

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Ten toes, ten toes, we was out in that road, uh
Lookin' for love in wrong places, we proposed to a stove, yeah
Shared jewels, shared clothes, that's how deep shit goes, yeah
Every week, ya got bros, all of y'all fake close
Y'all switchin' sides like NBA teams just after halftime
I'm pullin' up on my dog, make sure he okay, I don't even have time
He copped me a Porsche with butterscotch seats
This 'fore they had meals
Live better than rappers and they don't even have deals, that real
Bought Emory a BM as soon as he came home
We hopped on a plane, headed straight to the Bay
That's how we turn the game on, it's game on
Ty mama died, I was there, my nephew died, he was there
He in my house more than I be there, more than B there
Ty-Ty there, E there, Breezy there, Juan there
High here, Chaka there, Law there, they all here, ah yeah
Dez there, Kawanna here, shit feel like nirvana here
Crib like the SoHo House, I might stay in and grow out my hair
Tight circle, no squares, I'm geometrically opposed to you
Y'all like to try angles, y'all like to troll, do you?
Y'all talk around hoes, do you? Y'all don't follow codes do you?
You know everything you say from niggas close to you
You emotional; when I say free the dogs, I free 'em
That's how Meek got his freedom
Y'all put niggas on a t-shirt, it hurts you ain't never meet 'em
You got niggas in the feds, you ain't even tryna feed 'em
I'm tryna free the world, that's how deep I'm in
I ain't goin' to nobody nothin' when me and my wife beefin'
I don't care if the house on fire, I'm dyin', nigga, I ain't leavin'
Ty-Ty take care of my kids, after he done grievin'
If y'all don't understand that, we ain't meant to be friends

[Refrain: BeyoncÃ©]
Pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up)
And never let me down (they never let me down)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
And never let me drown (never let me drown)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up (pull me up)
And never let me down (never let me down)
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
They never let me down (never let me drown, never let me down)

[Verse 3: BeyoncÃ©]
They pray and pray for me, they pray and pray for me
See better things for me
Want better days for me unselfishly
They pray and pray for me, they pray and pray for me
Whenever I'm in need
They in the backseat with the aux bumpin' Bey
They don't cry at all, we don't cry and ball
In my car, car, car, you know, ball, ball hard
They my d-d-dogs
[?]
Point 'em out, out, out
Point 'em out, out, out
What would I be without my friends
(what would I be without my friends)
I ain't got no understanding
(I ain't got no understanding)
Rob them, you might catch these hands
We fall out and we make amends, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: BeyoncÃ©]
Your friends are foes, my friends are goals
Closer than kin, our souls exposed
Your friends are frauds, all they want is applause, yeah
And my friends, real friends, closer than kin

[Outro: BeyoncÃ©]
Come pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me drown
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me down
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them never let me down
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
Them pull me up, pull me up, pull me up
