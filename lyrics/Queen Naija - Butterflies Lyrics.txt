I don't wanna fall so fast
But I'm open
They always say that good things never last
And I know 'cause I've been broken
I'm trying to protect my heart
But you're making it so hard
And I guess it's safe to say
You take my pain away

And I just want to hold you all night long
Whenever I'm around you nothing's wrong
I'm hoping that you'll always be around
You got me on a high, I don't wanna come down

And I love it, I love it
These butterflies
Yeah, I love it, I love it
I'm on a high
Yeah, I love it, I love it
And I just wanna love on you

Ever since you crossed my path
Everything is different
You always know just how to make me laugh
You got me all up in my feelings
And as much as I love the feeling
I hate it, it gets me frustrated
When I say just how I feel but don't know how you would take it
Why do you do what you do to me?
Got me doing things that I don't do usually

I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But every time I see you I just want to risk it all
And baby yeah I know it ain't right
But the chemistry we have is so hard to fight

I just want to hold you all night long
Whenever I'm around you nothing's wrong
I'm hoping that you'll always be around
You got me on a high, I don't wanna to come down

And I love it, I love it
These butterflies
Yeah, I love it, I love it
I'm on a high
And I just wanna love on
I just wanna love on you

Just want to love, just want to love on ya (uh, uh)
Just want to love, just want to love on ya (uh, uh)
Hey, hey (uh, uh)

And I just want to know would you catch me if I fall (ooohhh)
If you tell me yeah, boy I might just risk it all
If you tell me no, it's okay then I will leave (ooohhh)
I hope you feel the same, you're the only one I see
I see, I see

Just want to love, just want to love on ya (uh, uh) (ooohhh)
Just want to love, just want to love on ya (uh, uh) (ooohhh)
Hey, hey (uh, uh)
