[Intro]
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8… (yeah)
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands, on the way to the top, 'til it's fallin' over

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

[Verse 1]
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now, watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top, all the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot, your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over"
I like the way that she treat me, gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah, I might blow my brain, yeah!
Xanny help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "I am not afraid to die"
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fakin'
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, lil' nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would become
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, though
Lookin' at you stackin’ all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, "You're the worst; you're the worst"
I cannot die, nigga this my universe

[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
