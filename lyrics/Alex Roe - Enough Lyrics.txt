Sitting in the dark all night fighting shadows,
And the urge to call you up hits me like an arrow.
It ain't the whiskey talking or the loneliness I'm feeling.
It's the memories, all the little things, that keep me from healing.

I'd give up all the days I got left on this earth,
'Cause without you I don't know what they're worth; no.

I'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.
This heart don't have a home without you in it; no.
I'd stand before you, as a man who's been broken.
Truer words never spoken.

Is that enough?
Is that enough,
For your love?

The flame I keep inside burns through rainy nights,
Even though I tried to put it out so many times.
Good Book's on the table so I can get some advice
When I can't rest my heavy head, 'cause I'm still lost in your eyes.

I'd give up all the days I got left on this earth,
'Cause without you I don't know what they're worth.

And I'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.
This heart don't have a home without you in it; no.
And I'd stand before you as a man who's been broken
Truer words never spoken; no.

Is that enough?
Is that enough,
For your love?

I'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.
This heart don't have a home without you in it; no.
I'd stand before you, as a man who's been broken.
Truer words never spoken; no.

Is that enough?
Is that enough?
Is that enough?
Is that enough,
For your love?
