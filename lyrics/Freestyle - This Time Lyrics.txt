Oh I'm sorry, girl, for causing you much pain
Didn't mean to make you cry, make your efforts all in vain
And I apologize for all the things I've done
You were loving me so much but all I did was let you down

Oh, I really don't know just what to say
All I know is that I want you to stay

This time, I'm not gonna let you slip away
This time, I'm not gonna let another day go by
Without holding you so tight
Without treating you so right

This time, I'm not gonna let go of your love
This time, I promise you that we'll rise above it all
And I will never let you fall
I'm gonna give you my all, this time

Oh, I never thought that I was hurting you
Now I know that I was wrong, now I know just what to do
Gonna try to be the best that I could be
All I need is one more chance to make it up to you, you'll see

And there's one more thing that you oughta know
All I know is that I don't want you to go
