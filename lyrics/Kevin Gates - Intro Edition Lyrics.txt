I only know one way
The dumb way
You gon' have to keep up with me on here

Handle the business, I'm all man
We had to drink from a storm drain
In front of the judge and the storm came
But I got it in like Lebron James
Don't give a fuck about ball man
But will put a dent in yo bald fade
Dickin' the denim, no log play
I used to click in the hallway
Brick of the grits, yellin' fish
Hit assist, money legit
Bayou Classic, rockin' a fit
Shit that I sip, more than your rent
I took a pledge when I came in the game
Gave that pussy nigga back his lil' chain
Diamond link on the beat when it hang
My bitch bad with a booty that swing
Fake shit, done polluted the game
Took a loss, stayed true to the game
Big boss, bought a coupe and a Range
Big dawg, got a shooter who aim
Wrong move, It'll cost you your brain
Finessed move, he finessin my dame
Fucked over, I ain't ashamed to admit it
Came back, then I ran up a ticket
I'm him, yeah, the gangsta edition
Walked down, really spankin' a nigga
Say they plannin on yankin' a nigga
On the Gram now, I'm likin' they pictures
No plate, pulin' up in a rental
Hop out, this a animal issue
Surgical, what I am with a pistol
Swaying colors, draw big ammunition
Neckway, an animal with it
Get away, gotta get to the clearin'
Kill a junkie who was driving a witness
Burn the fingerprints after we finish
Tap in, tell Gunna come get me
In Atlanta, layin' low in the city
King branded, let me suck on your titty
Wait, I feel it and I'm rippin her kidney
Diamond teeth when I lick on her kitty
Only thing I ain't doin', no kissing
Been played, I ain't get in my feelings
Sad thing, it was one of my niggas
Both ways, I get money, a killa
No way, I ain't doin' no stealing
Big gangsta, really one of them niggas
Dennis Loud's really one of them niggas
EMC, super dope in the ceiling
Anthony Ree, controllin' the building
You get on that button, you know how we livin'
I'm pushin' that button, whoever wanna get it
Big brick, talking on the yard
Clientele up, flooded all
Met a plug, then I met a plug
I'm the only drug dealer on the wall
Mutual con, shout out to Quan
Baby go down, from Mutual Quan |
Den do rango [?]
I do my shit without a nigga knowin'
Walk in, room get to glowin'
Placed a order, but you didn't know it
Makin' baby lately, shit been borin'
Bread winner did it from the corner

I get the picture, right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out
I get the picture, right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out

Stop playin', why is you playin'?
I am not playin', I'm in the yeah
I'm just sayin', what is you saying?
I do not say, how much is yeah
Stop playin', right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out

ZO6, Chanel on the seat
Put 'em on feet, fuck up the street
Diamond my link, diamond my teeth
Now is a feat, buy me to speak, yeah
Cocaine, sexy motherfucker
Uptown flexin' in the gutter
Was broke, now I'm flexin' for the summer
Back then ain't nobody love me
Cleats on, stomping in the jungle
Let's get ready for the rumble
Will skeet at ya', I don't stutter
Talk loud, bet ya' I won't mumble
Real fly jacket, how I'm comin
Freshest in the district, but I'm humble
Dealing with addiction, I'm a junkie
Losing weight running to the money
Having plenty paper been accustomed
Leavin' out a tailor, get it custom
Pray my baby make it in through customs
Fuck her, send her right back to her country
Puerto Rican Johnny, you know I love you
My exchange is foreign, kinda cut me
Pourin' drinks, still like it muddy
Freak ya' bitch, still like 'em slutty
Kitchen phone ring
Breakin' down a whole thing
Two-fifty-two in every pie
Not a piece, a whole thing
Mixin' H with Quan now
Take him one, two whole days
Molly grits, supply the stripper
Buy the triple on private planes
Read a book, then took a nap
Enjoyed the things that powder bring
Haters hate, that's on the daily
Expected that when power came
Overseas, the hours changed
Spent the weekend counting change
Regular shit, I'mma go in a minute
Pullin' garages, and openin' fender
Won't talk to a hoe, told her open her dentures
Get out her pockets, you go on restriction
All in my comments, I pay no attention
Militant men with a militant interest
Muslim seeking in need of a lender
Stay on your Deen and he know that we meant it
Try to come play me, I'm dodging a visit
He know it's illegal to charge him a interest
Food for the homeless, who sleeping on benches
You play with my sister, you know that it's tension
Carpenter, carpenter the way I be nailing shit
Carpet the bitches that waitin' to bill it
Plumber went pipin' inside of the biscuit
[?] extensions
Sauce on the table, the waiter come get it
My cup runneth over with flavor, I'm drippin
Thumbin' through paper, I'm not comin' to kick it
You prolly won't see me unless you comin' with it
Hit my lieutenant, he trailin' the bentley
With something exclusive, and it's not a semi
My window not tinted
I want you to see all the jewelry I got on my shit, goin' digi
I'mma unblock everybody on insta
I'm livin' like that, I know you get the picture

I get the picture, right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out
I get the picture, right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out
Stop playin', why is you playin'?
I am not playin, I'm in the yeah
I'm just sayin', what is you saying?
I do not say, I'mma just, yeah
Stop playin', right now
Lil' bitty bitch, bite down
One of my wrists, iced out
Gorillas don't hit with the lights out
Stop playin'
