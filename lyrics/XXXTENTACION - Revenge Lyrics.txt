I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
From mistakes I made in my past
I think thats the first step, right?
Do you agree?

I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect,
Leaving you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, oh would I?
some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us, my dear
Can't pretend that I was perfect, leaving you in fear
Oh man, what a world, the things I hear
If I could act on my revenge, then oh, would I?
Some kill, some steal, some break your heart
And you thought that I would let it go, and let you walk
Well, broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go

So in my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
In my grave I'll rot
