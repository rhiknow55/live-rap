[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Get it, text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting nothing
Even then you don't worry none
And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We can either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay lets rock and roll this
Time to go, lock, stock and two smoking barrels
Locked and loaded
Diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner line 'em up to block and over
Times I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, I sold, the pack, the loose, the hard (yeah)
I listened, to X, I peeped, the bars (yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The games, a trap, protect, your heart (yeah)
I waited, in line, return, refine
The new, design, it's time, to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world, is mine
So please, believe, allow, the greaze
These niggas, disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make, the devil, go weak, the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uhh, she came, I came, now what's, my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know, it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard, my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babe
My girls, my ex, them hoes that I left
The way, I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise, the Lord, then break, the law
I take, what's mine, then take, some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
