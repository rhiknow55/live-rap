Y'all
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen baby
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though white boy

It's everyday bro
With the Disney channel flow
Five mill on YouTube in 6 months
Never done before
Pass all the competition man
Pewdiepie is next
Man I'm poppin' all these checks
Got the brand new Rolex
And I met the Lambo too
And I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch
Who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out
If they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you
You beggin for attention
Talking shit on Twitter too
But you still hit my phone last night
It was 4: 52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too
Don't make me tell them the truth
And I just drop some new merch
And they're selling like a God church
Ohio is where I'm from
We chew'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun
The tattoo's just for fun
Ah you say boat and run
Catch me at game on
I cannot be outdone

Jake Paul is number one

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro

It's everyday bro
I said it is everyday bro!

You know is Nick Crompton
And my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap
And no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if you work for Team 10

Then the US would be shitty
And I'll pass it to Chance
'Cuz you know he stay litty

Two months ago
You didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up
I'm only going up
Now, I'm going off
I'm never fallin' off
Like Magg, who?
Digi who?
Who are you?
All these beefs I just ran through
Hit a milli in a month
Where were you?
Hatin' on me back in West
Thinking need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top
Now, we really poppin' off
Number one and number four
That's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top
So we all goin'
We left Ohio

Now the trio is all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it is everyday bro!

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Can we switch the language?
SÃ­, lo Ãºnico que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el dÃ­a entero
Viviendo en U.S.A
El sueÃ±o de cualquiera
Enviando dÃ³lares a mi familia entera

Tenemos una persona por encima
Se llama Donald Trump y estÃ¡ en la cima
Desde aquÃ­ te cantamos
Can I get my VISA?

Martinez Twins, representando EspaÃ±a
Desde la pobreza a la fama

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it is everyday bro!

Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook

Lemme educate ya'
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home?
So, stop calling my phone
I'm flying like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy cologne?

Is that your boy's cologne?
Starting ballin' quick and loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, the all copy me
But, that's some shitty clones
Hey and all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said it's ten with six zeroes
Always plug, merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cuz
It's everyday bro
Peace!
