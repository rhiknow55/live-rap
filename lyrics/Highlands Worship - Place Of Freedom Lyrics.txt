There's a calm that covers me
When I kneel down at Your feet
It's a place of healing
It's a place where I find freedom

There's a place my eyes can't see
Where my spirit longs to be
It's a place of healing
It's a place I live in freedom

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

There's a love that lives in me
For You Lord, my savior King
Breaks the sin that's binding
And leads me to a place of freedom

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

There is no one
that can bring me peace
That can wash me clean
like you Lord
There is nothing
in this world that can free me
You saved my soul

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I've come to worship
We've come to worship
We've come to lift Your Name high

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna lift my hands
Til I can reach heaven
I'm gonna shout Your name
Til the walls come falling down
I've come to worship
I've come to worship

I'm gonna sing my song
Like I am unashamed
I'm gonna shout for joy
At the mention of your name
I've come to worship
I've come to worship
