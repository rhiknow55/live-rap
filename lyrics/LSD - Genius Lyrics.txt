Labrinth

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm bat shit crazy, having you on my mind
Do you think I'm helpless?
My algebra gon' equal you every time
Do you think I'm calling?
Do you think I'm calling out your name every night
Girl I've fallen for you

What, what you say?

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e

O-only a genius will love a woman like she

O-o-only a genius will love a woman like she

[Verse 2: Sia]
Oh!
You'll be my Einstein, my Newton, my Galileo, and my Hawking
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm on my neck while I'm walking
Please understand, I have fallen for you, you

What, what you say?

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
Oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e

Well, only a genius could love a woman like me
Oh my god, you're the lock and I'm the key-e-e

Well, only a genius could love a woman like me

[Outro: Both]
Oh, oh
Cause I love a woman like you
He's a genius
Cause I love a woman like you
